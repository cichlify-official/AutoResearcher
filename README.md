Step 2: README and Project Roadmap

README.md (Basic Structure)

Here’s a starting point for the README. Update it in your repo:

# AI Research Assistant 🚀  
An autonomous AI agent that **conducts research, summarizes papers, and generates new insights** using **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and **large language models (LLMs)**.

## 🌟 Features  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Fetches and processes research papers.  
- **LLM-Powered Summarization** – Summarizes complex papers into key insights.  
- **Autonomous Query Refinement** – Iteratively improves research based on results.  
- **Hypothesis Generator** – Suggests new research directions based on extracted knowledge.  
- **Interactive Web UI** – Allows users to input topics and get AI-generated reports.  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI  
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4, LangChain, FAISS, Pinecone  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (or SvelteKit if you want it more advanced)  
- **Data Sources**: ArXiv API, Semantic Scholar API  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
1. **Clone the repo:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cichlify/AI-Research-Agent.git
