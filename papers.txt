Lecture Notes: Optimization for Machine Learning -  The provided text refers to lecture notes on the topic of optimization in machine learning. These notes have been compiled from a course offered at Princeton University, as well as tutorial sessions given in MLSS (Machine Learning Summer School), Buenos Aires, and the Simons Foundation, Berkeley. In essence, it highlights learning materials related to the optimization techniques used in machine learning, originating from multiple reputable sources.
An Optimal Control View of Adversarial Machine Learning -  The text presents an "optimal control" perspective on adversarial machine learning. In this framework, the machine learner is considered as a dynamical system, and adversarial actions are the input. The goal of the adversary (attacker) is defined by causing harm and being hard to detect, which are considered as control costs. This view encompasses various types of adversarial machine learning such as test-item attacks, training-data poisoning, and adversarial reward shaping. The author suggests that researchers in this field should leverage advancements in control theory and reinforcement learning to progress in their research.
Minimax deviation strategies for machine learning and recognition with
  short learning samples -  The article discusses the issue of small learning samples in machine learning, focusing on the shortcomings of Maximum Likelihood Learning and Minimax Learning. It proposes a solution called Minimax Deviation Learning, which reportedly addresses these flaws and provides an alternative approach.
