Lecture Notes: Optimization for Machine Learning -  These lecture notes are a compilation of concepts related to optimization in machine learning, sourced primarily from a course at Princeton University, supplemented by additional materials from tutorials provided in MLSS, Buenos Aires, and the Simons Foundation, Berkeley. The focus is on optimizing algorithms used in machine learning, which is crucial for training models effectively and making accurate predictions.
An Optimal Control View of Adversarial Machine Learning -  In this text, the author presents an "optimal control view" of adversarial machine learning. This perspective positions the machine learner as a dynamical system and defines adversarial actions as inputs. The cost, or the objective for the adversary, includes causing harm and being undetectable. This comprehensive approach encompasses various types of adversarial machine learning such as test-item attacks, training-data poisoning, and adversarial reward shaping. The author suggests that researchers in this field should leverage advancements in control theory and reinforcement learning.
Minimax deviation strategies for machine learning and recognition with
  short learning samples -  The article discusses the issue of small learning samples in machine learning, specifically focusing on the flaws of Maximum Likelihood Learning and Minimax Learning. It proposes an alternative method called Minimax Deviation Learning, which addresses these flaws by offering a more effective solution for training models with limited data.
